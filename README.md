# Hello AI - Python Prompting Course

A Python project for learning AI prompting techniques using Claude AI's API. This repository contains practical examples and exercises for understanding how to craft effective prompts for AI language models.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Basic AI prompting concepts
- Text processing and instruction following
- API integration with Anthropic's Claude
- Practical examples of prompt engineering

## Features

- **Prompt Engineering Examples**: Learn how to structure prompts for better AI responses
- **Text Analysis**: Process and analyze text using AI assistance
- **API Integration**: Direct connection to Claude's API for real-time responses
- **Learning Exercises**: Hands-on examples for prompt optimization

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fragualej/hello-python.git
cd hello-python
```

2. Set up virtual environment:
```bash
cd hello-ai
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install anthropic python-dotenv
```

4. Create a `.env` file with your API key:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

Run the main script to see prompting examples in action:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script demonstrates:
- How to structure prompts for instruction following
- Text analysis and processing
- Error handling for API calls

## Examples

The project includes examples of:
- **Instruction Detection**: Identifying and reformatting step-by-step instructions
- **Text Classification**: Analyzing different types of content
- **Prompt Optimization**: Techniques for getting better AI responses

## Learning Objectives

- Understand prompt structure and formatting
- Learn to write clear, specific instructions for AI
- Practice with real API interactions
- Explore different prompting strategies
